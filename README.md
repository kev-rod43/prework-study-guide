# <UMN Bootcamp PreWork Study Guide>

## Description

- I created this webapp to provide myself and others a way to read some introductory information about HTML, CSS, JS, and Git. This barebone website provides a structure that I can use to add and review notes that are accessible on any internet capable device. Through the creation of this project I learned many basic syntax rules for the previously mentioned languages, and learned the Git workflow and the best practices associated with it.

## Usage

Upon entering the webapp, you will see four different sections that display notes and a few useful links to be able to reference for future coding. Upon opening the DevTools console, you can see a JS script running that lists the different sections/topics and it randomly assigns one to study.
